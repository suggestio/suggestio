- Created, edit, delete user's nodes (if logged-in).
- Scan for radio signals (WiFi, Bluetooth beacons, etc possibly).
- Register and manage radio-signal sources as own nodes (by WiFi MAC-address, by Bluetooth beacon UID, etc).
- Write NFC tags.
- Publish/unpublish currently-opened ad on user's nodes.
